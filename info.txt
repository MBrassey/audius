Production Setup:
- One VM with docker-compose for Discovery and one for Creator
- Create replica VM's and configure a load balancer and healthcheck 

- Supports Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
- VM Specs:

Creator

8 vCPU (16 vCPU recommended)
16 GiB RAM (32 GiB recommended)
2 TiB SSD for creator-node

Discovery

8 vCPU (16 vCPU recommended)
16 GiB RAM (32 GiB recommended)
256 GiB SSD for discovery-provider

Hey, this is probably the best guide for running the services: https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/main/dev-tools

We used to use k8s but it actually made everything more complicated since it's designed to run on a single node. Docker swarm is deprecated (I think?) so we don't use that either. Just plan docker-compose is how we dev and deploy the services

for production, discovery nodes and content nodes are generally kept on separate VMs. If you're tryna run production nodes, this might be more useful for you: https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose

As for high availability and the likes, decentralized systems are antifragile because they're built on top of a bunch of fragile pieces. No individual nodes really needs high availability because the network expects nodes to go up and down. 

tl;dr for high availability, I'd say just run multiple VMs with multiple content/discovery nodes
